# fluttery_music_player [In build process]

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

Hi everyone,
I am excited to share my latest addition to Flutter UI Repository.
This is a music application that took me only 2 Days at max to develop. The application supports playing songs in both iOS and Android. Google has done some commendable work. 

This goes to show how powerful Flutter is and I am just contributing on my part to the beautiful community.
